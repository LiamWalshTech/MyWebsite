Today I'm going to share with you how I applied the ideas, concepts and methods from, Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss into my life to gain a promotion, increase engagement in my projects and how you can to.

This book has given me the tools, understanding and mindset to achieve things in my work that I have never managed before. It would have taken my much longer to make progress without it.

Most people's career progress starts to stagnate once they hit a certain point where their technical skills are no longer the deciding factor. They fail to improve their soft skills like communication, negotiation and persuasion.

- A brief introduction to the book and the author
- The 6 best ideas from the book, how they're relevant to software engineers and how to apply them
- 1 highly effective action you can take to your next one-to-one meeting

If you want one of the most powerful tools in life at your disposal then keep reading.

### A brief introduction

Written by Chris Voss this book delves into the art of negotiation based on his lived in experience as a hostage negotiator. He debunks widely accepted wisdom by using examples of how the theory doesn't work out when put into the field.

He's had a majorly successful TED talk, appeared on numerous podcasts and runs the Black Swan Group. A company providing resources and training based on the concepts in this book.

I love this book as I can hear his voice through his writing, you know it comes from Chris. The stories are incredibly engaging and showed how the concepts applied to high stakes scenarios.

It's just the right length too, avoiding the any filler. It's not that long so you can probably finish it in one intense reading session.

Here are the things I learned and how I applied them.

### 1. Negotiation is discovery

Most people think negotiation is a battle of wits, cunning and underhanded tactics.

They're completely wrong.

Quoting Chris:

> Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible.

Negotiation is discovery.

You shouldn't go into a negotiation thinking you're going to flatten the other person like the Wolf of Wall Street. Nobody wants to negotiate with that kind of person.

When you're negotiating you're constantly trying to find out more about the other person and what they want.

Understanding what scenario you're in and what the other person is either expecting from you or wanting from you gives you the ability to frame your goals in a way that aligns with their own.

I applied this by communicating with people I work with to understand their problems, their goals and the things they care about.

Through this I was able to discover how I could contribute in ways that helped us both get what we want. A true win-win situation.

### 2. It's never about you

This applies to a lot of things but especially for negotiations.

Even if the topic is about you, e.g. asking/applying for a promotion, it still isn't about you.

It's about how your promotion affects your manager's responsibilities and how it contributes to their goals.

This might sound a little pessimistic and negative but in reality people are far too busy and bogged down to really prioritise you over their own problems, challenges and goals.

And I'd say that's fair.

We're all striving for growth and success.

The things you want rarely come from your actions alone but rather from how your actions create positive outcomes, situations and feelings for others.

Try and frame your own goals and actions around the positive outcomes it produces for those around you and you'll never struggle for progress.

I applied this various situations which included getting time for a project which otherwise would have been labelled as "tech debt". It resulted in improved delivery and quality of life for various teams in the business and I was the key piece in the value delivery.

### 3. Guarantee execution

The single greatest downfall for any collaborative project is uncommitted contributors.

Imagine if Théoden said "yes, yes, Rohan will answer" but then him and the riders never showed up to Minas Tirith? It would be game over!

Don't fall for the trap of an empty yes. A "leave me alone yes" is what Chris calls it.

> 'Yes' is nothing without 'How.'

Instead you need to strive for a committed yes.

Chris gives two tips in how to get a committed yes: 1. The Rule of Three - Getting someone to agree three times throughout the conversation avoids potential lies 2. Establish the How and When - what are they going to do and when are they going to do it by

The first one simply roots out anybody who isn't a sociopath. Most people won't continuously lie or answer a question dishonestly multiple times.

The second is very important because you want them to tell you how they're going to get something done and by when. It's really important it comes from them because it means they've thought about it and are now willing to invest their time and reputation on it.

I applied this in shared projects I worked on to improve engagement and gain active contributors who were invested in delivering. It meant more people were actively contributing, getting recognition and the system improved as a whole for everyone.

### 4. Tactical empathy

This phrase was coined by Chris' and it generally means:
"Making the other person feel heard and understood"

He clarifies by explaining that empathy does not mean you agree with them but that you truly understand their point of view.

This is one of the best ways you can build rapport with somebody as it makes you more engaging and trustworthy.

Another great quote from Chris around this point:

> Everyone of us has the inherent, human need to be understood, to connect with the person across the table.

If you want people to collaborate with you then you need trust. You need to be able to connect with that person in a genuine way.

It couples nicely with active listening. Giving people you're undivided attention and listening to exactly what they say.

It's difficult!

You need to withhold your personal thoughts, judgements avoid entering conversation with a protective and self affirming mindset.

I applied this by reaching out and listening to those who were using the tools and projects I helped create and really listening to what they were saying.

Gathering feedback in raw unfiltered format to remove my bias and to get my ego out of the way so I could see it for what it was.

Not feel threatened because I felt like it was a jab at me or anyone else who worked on the project.

This allowed me to improve the project for those who used it but were frustrated with how things currently were.

### 5. Compromise is a lose-lose outcome

I'll start with a quote from Chris because it encapsulates it beautifully.

> Splitting the difference is wearing one black and one brown shoe, so don’t compromise.

Compromise is when you get the best of both, right?

Wrong, what happens more often than not is a solution or outcome that is a bit Frankenstein. The true vision is gone and what's left is at best mediocre or at worst the ugliest parts of each vision.

So how do you avoid compromise? When two or more people can't decide on something then how do you move forward?

The answer. You have to change what they want.

And this is the hardest part of negotiation.

A compromise has all those involved feeling like they've had to give up something. That's a loss.

If you change what they want then it removes that downside.

I'll admit I don't think I can come up with an example I've managed to pull this off with work.

But I have managed to get my 6 year old son to want to try his veggies!

### 6. Prepare, prepare, prepare

Measure once, cut twice. Fail to plan then plan to fail. There's many phrases that echo this truth.

If you don't prepare you just asking for failure.

You should always go into a negotiation with a plan.

Like Chris highlights:

> When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion—you fall to your highest level of preparation.

He even has a [one sheet](https://www.blackswanltd.com/download-the-negotiation-one-sheet) on his company website that you can use as a template to fill out before going into a negotiation.

Go into the negotiation prepared but not like a door-to-door salesman reading from a script.

Chris recommends not forcing the negotiation with "yes" orientated questions (a question they can only logically say yes to) but empower them with "no orientated questions".

Saying no is more powerful than saying yes. It's why one of everyone's first words when they're babies is no.

It sets boundaries. Give them the sense of control.

I applied this when going for promotion by using the one sheet. Simply filling it out forced me to clarify what exactly it was that I wanted and forced me to think about what could potentially be a deal breaker for this advancement.

### Take this one question to your next one-to-one meeting

> What are some of the most business critical projects I can be involved in that will impact the future of the company for the better?

This is a very clear and effective question.

It highlights you as a person that has a genuine interest in furthering the success of the company and those around you.

It shows ambition aimed at a goal that isn't completely self serving.

You want to move yourself towards projects that have big, positive impact to the business. Not only for the value they deliver but also the experience they provide.

The most high value projects tend to be some of the most interesting and difficult projects to undertake. They'll teach you a lot and you'll become a lot more valuable as a result.

## Thanks for reading

This book has really opened my eyes in ways I never thought possible. Not only for software development but for life in general.

Like Chris says:

> Allow me to let you in on a secret: Life is negotiation.

Thanks for reading.
