  <h2>My story so far</h2>

  <p>
    I've always loved using and playing on computers. Ever since asking Jeeves
    for help with beating Tomb Raider 2's final boss I've been drawn to
    computers and the internet like nothing else.
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied computing at college and university. My final year project was to
    build a chess forum with the overarching concept of viewers and spectators
    inspired by the movie "Becoming John Malkovich". It was an awful hacked
    toether mess of PHP, HTML tables and dodgy CSS but I loved every second of
    making it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've been in the industry over 13 years. I've worked in-house roles for
    eccomerce, digital agencies and software engineering product teams. These
    roles have allowed my to work with various companies including BAFTA,
    ClearChannel, Sainsbury's, Cottages.com, Hoseasons, Novasol and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've worked with various languages and technology stacks over the years but
    my speciality and greater experience is in UI/UX and Front End. I've been
    lucky to enjoy working with such projects and brands. I was really
    comfortable with my abilities to deliver web based proucts effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    But in 2018 I had the biggest wakeup call of my life. My son was born and
    during the lead up to his arrival till now I have been on a new mission. To
    find people who can benefit from my experience and journey the most. To be
    able to help them along their journey and hopefully achieve the goals they
    dream about.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can no longer spend all my time for my own benefit. I see my son and see
    how far I have come and want, need and have to give back to those who need
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So now I'm starting my personal brand, sharing my experience and knowledge
    through content in various formats. Building, learning, reading, teaching
    and building a community of like-minded individuals who wish to become the
    best version of themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can check out exactly what I'm working on right now on my <a href="/now"
      >now page</a
    >. I update this every week with my current progress with various projects

  <h2>What I write about</h2>

  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>

    Learn about various languages, frameworks and working practices. Benefit
    from career advice based on my past experience and advice from successful
    individuals I talk to.
  </p>

  <h3>Health and Fitness</h3>
  <p>
    I believe having a healthy body is the highest priority before everything

    back to a healthy life, body and mind after falling off more than three
    times!
  </p>

  <h3>Wealth</h3>
  <p>
    I'm not financial expert but I've learned a lot about wealth (clue, it's not
    about how much money you have) over the years. I've made plenty of mistakes
    but also had a lot of wins that have gave us lasting benefits.
