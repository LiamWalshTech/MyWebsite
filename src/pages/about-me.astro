  <h2>My story so far</h2>

  <p>
    I've always loved using and playing on computers. Ever since asking Jeeves
    for help with beating Tomb Raider 2's final boss I've been drawn to
    computers and the internet like nothing else
  </p>

  <p>
    I studied computing at college and university. My final year project was to
    build a chess forum with the overarching concept of viewers and spectators
    inspired by the movie "Becoming John Malkovich". It was an awful hacked
    toether mess of PHP, HTML tables and dodgy CSS but I loved every second of
    making it.
